#**Project Title**

Personal Portfolio Website- Final Project for General Assembly Front End Web Development Course.


#**Getting Started:**

Install any text editor to view code. Final project can be viewed on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Firefox using a Mac or Windows PC.

#**Project Overview:**

In a nutshell, this project is about ME! It is my self named website. It is fairly basic now as I am still learning, however with time it will change and be used as a reminder of where I started.

#**Configuration Instructions:**

I created this site with my Handy Dandy MacBook Pro.

#**Files Included:**

There are 4 HTML files- 

-Index

-About Me

-Portfolio

-Contact

There is one CSS file

-Style.css

There is one Javascript file

-index.js

There is an image folder with various images.

**This site was created solely by me, Tivona Abron, with the help of my General Assembly class, my instructor Noura and my best friend Google. :)**

#**Troubleshooting:**

-Since I am a JavaScript novice, some of the code is not generating my animation to my liking. 

-My CSS animation is not timed correctly so it is too fast. Working on getting the time right.
